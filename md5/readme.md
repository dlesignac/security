# MD5

This project is an implementation of the MD5 message-digest algorithm (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)).


**Warning**: although a message can be hashed by this program, we were not abled to reproduce the exact MD5 hash (probably an issue with endianness).

Use *make all* to compile source files.  
Use *make test* to apply MD5 to test file.  
Use *./md5 file* to apply MD5 to file.
