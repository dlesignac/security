# Sentry

This project is an implementation of the Feige-Fiat-Shamir identification scheme (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feige%E2%80%93Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_identification_scheme)).


Client / server architecture is used here : sentry is the server, intruder and grantee are the clients.

Use *make all* to compile sentry, intruder and grantee.  
Use *./sentry* to run sentry in a terminal.  
Use *./intruder* or *./grantee* in another terminal.
