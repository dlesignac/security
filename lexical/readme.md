# Lexical analyzer

This project consists in a lexical analyzer that will look for some signatures inside an heaxidecimal-encoded file. This feature can be useful to find a virus' signature inside a suspect file.

Use *make compile* to compile source files.  
Use *make test* to analyze a test file where several signatures have been inserted on purpose.
